/*
 * Program entrypoint.
 * 
 * Beyond the module name as the first parameter, this program
 * optionally takes an additional parameter that must be a
 * case-sensitive match for the letter "d".  If there are no parameters
 * beyond the module name, the program will be in normal mode.  If the
 * "d" parameter is provided, the program will be in doubling mdoe.
 * 
 * Any other parameters provided to the program results in an error.
 * 
 * In normal mode, the program reads from standard input, passes it
 * through a sequence of input filters matching section 3 of the 3V:C4-5
 * draft of the Shastina Specification, and writes the filtered results
 * to standard output.
 * 
 * Additionally, the filtered results will be passed through some
 * additional output filters in normal mode:
 * 
 * (1) At the start of each line, the line number as determined by the
 * line count filter will be written as a zero-padded three-digit number
 * followed by a colon and a space.
 * 
 * (2) All filtered bytes that are outside of non-whitespace US-ASCII
 * printing range (0x21-0x7e) will be written in the form <ab> where a
 * and b are the base-16 digits of the unsigned byte value.
 * 
 * (3) After all the filtered results have been printed, a final status
 * line will be printed that reports the line number as determined by
 * the line count filter at the very end of input.  The report will also
 * indicate if a UTF-8 Byte Order Mark (BOM) has been filtered out by
 * the filter chain.
 * 
 * In doubling mode, the filtered input will be echoed to standard
 * output without any of the output filters described above.  Instead,
 * the pushback buffer filter will be used to double each character that
 * is in non-whitespace US-ASCII printing range (0x21-0x7e) by pushing
 * each such character back once.
 * 
 * Any errors will be reported to stderr and cause the program to stop.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 * 
 *   argc - the number of elements in argv
 * 
 *   argv - an array of pointers to null-terminated strings representing
 *   the program arguments, with the first argument representing the
 *   module name and any arguments after that representing additional
 *   parameters passed on the command line
 * 
 * Return:
 * 
 *   zero if successful, one if there was an error
