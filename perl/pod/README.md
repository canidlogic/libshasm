# Shastina Perl documentation

This directory contains compiled Markdown documentation files for each of the Shastina parser Perl modules.  Each of these documentation files (excluding this README) were auto-generated from the POD documentation found in each of the Perl modules.

`Parser.md` is a good place to start for understanding the Shastina Perl library.
