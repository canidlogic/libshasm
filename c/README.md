# Shastina C library

This subdirectory contains the C implementation of the Shastina parser.

The whole Shastina C parsing library is contained in just the `shastina.c` and `shastina.h` source files.  It has no dependencies.  See the header for comprehensive documentation of the public interface of the C library.

A test program is provided as `shasm.c`.  See the source code in that program for an example of how to use the Shastina library.

For the Shastina specification, see the main directory of `libshastina`.
